# 3D_TO_cast_glass
Three-dimensional topology optimization algorithm for the design of cast glass components.

Functions_used folder contains functions used in the algorithm. 
TO_algorithm folder contains different variations of the topology optimization code. 
There are two versions that completely function in matlab, the boundary conditions here have to be defined in code. The two versions are a volume optimization and a compliance optimization. 
There is a version of the volume optimization that uses a grasshopper script to define the boundary conditions. 

How to use the algorithm in combination with grasshopper:
